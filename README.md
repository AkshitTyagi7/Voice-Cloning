### Local Installation

If you want to use this on your own computer, you must have an NVIDIA GPU.

First, install pytorch using these instructions: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
On Windows, I **highly** recommend using the Conda installation path. I have been told that if you do not do this, you
will spend a lot of time chasing dependency problems.
